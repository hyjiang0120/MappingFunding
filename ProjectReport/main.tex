% Start with going to Settings/packages.tex and change the pdftitle and pdfauthor variables.

% Then make changes to pages in the Content folder, such as abstract, acknowledgement, declaration, supervisor and titlepage.

% Add your citations in the BibTex format in the citation.bib file. These can be found via the publisher website.

% Finally, add your content to chapters and appendices. Read all of them first as there might be some command explained there that you don't know. Additionally, add your figures to the Figure folder to keep them organised.

% Keep adding new chapters and appendices at their relevant places.
